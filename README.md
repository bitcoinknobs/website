# Bitcoin Knobs - Website

Static site for the Bitcoin Knobs project.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use any static server.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Replace `your-user` and `your-repo` in `index.html`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` with your GitHub username and repo.
2. Commit all files to the `main` branch.
3. In GitHub, go to Settings -> Pages. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch", Branch: `main` with root `/`.
4. Wait for Pages to publish. Your site will be at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.

Optional: keep `.nojekyll` so GitHub Pages serves files without Jekyll processing.
